@article{Imre11,
    abstract = {In spatial ecology, habitat fragmentation is an important problem since its increase may create habitat remnants threatening species survival. There are several descriptors to characterize the processes leading to fragmentation. Some of them are model-dependent, while others suffer from the combined error of the perimeter and area measurements of the fragmented patches. In this article – using a theoretical model and a worked example – we would like to show that the Korcak-plot (and the corresponding fractal dimension, the Korcak-dimension) is not only a proper way to describe patchiness, but also applicable to detect secondary processes, like re-forestation, following the primary fragmentation.},
